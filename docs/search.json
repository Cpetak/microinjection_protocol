Use a 10ul pipette tip. Make sure to get the liquid from the top/middle of the tube in order to avoid any precipitate stuck to the bottom/sides of the tube during the centrifugation.\nPut a piece of clay on the side of a table and push the needle upside down into it. Fill needle by touching the end of the needle with the tip of the pipette and pushing out the liquid with the pipette. Make sure that the liquid enters the needle instead of just sitting on top.\n\n\n\nFilling needles\n\n\nMount needle onto the macromanipulator:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Insert needle into needle holder, end first, make sure needle end is visible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Needle in needle holder\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Using the needle holder (aka grip head)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Take off capillary holder (metal rod) and screw in needle holder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Make sure that the capillary holder is at 30°\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Setting up macromanipulator\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing the petri dish\nTake a PS-coated petri dish, mark middle with a straight black line with marker on the outer side of the dish. Take a razor blade and make a cut parallel to the black line halfway between the black line and the edge of the dish on the inner side of the dish. This scratch will be important to break the injection needle to adjust the flow of solution as needed.\n\n\n\nPrepared petri dish\n\n\nPipette 4 ml of 1 mM 3-AT sea water (prepared in the first step of “Collecting eggs and sperm”) into the PS-coated dish.\nPlace petri dish under microscope, such that the scratch mark is on the left.\nSwitch on the microscope and the FemtoJet 4i. Make sure to detach the injection tube first!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Switch on power strip to switch on microscope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Switch on FemtoJet with the button on the back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) FemtoJet starts to build up pressure automatically, make sure tube is disconnected\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Turning on equipment\n\n\nOnce the pressure has built up, attach the injection tube to the FemtoJet (TODO note about the ring size). If you see the error message below, make sure that the injection tube is correctly attached to the FemtoJet, and that the needle in the needle holder is all the way in and the tube is screwed on right.\n\n\n\nMicroinjector error\n\n\nLower needle into the sea water using the macromanipulator. Once the needle touches the water, find the needle through the microscope and lower/adjust focus until the needle touches the bottom of the petri dish. Navigate to the scratch mark. Gently touch the scratch with the end of the needle to break it very slightly. Check with the fluorescent light that there is a good flow of solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Broken needle with scratch mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n(b) High speed of injection solution flow, this will be hard to work with\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n(c) Ideal speed of injection solution flow\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Setting up needle in the sea water\n\n\n\n\nRowing the eggs and fertilization\nRow 10ul of dejellied eggs in a straight line using a 10 ul pipette tip. If the eggs have been sitting in the glass beaker for a while, they tend to stick to the bottom and pipetting up with the 10ul pipette tip might become difficult. Use a 3ml transfer pipette to pipette up and down near the eggs to stir them up.\n\n\n\nStir eggs with transfer pipette\n\n\non the dish parallel and in-between the two lines mentioned above using a pipette. Row the eggs right before the injections, because fertilization problems may occur due to prolonged exposure to 3-AT sea water."
