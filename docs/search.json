Take a razor blade and make a cut parallel to the black line halfway between the black line and the edge of the dish on the inner side of the dish. This scratch will be important to break the injection needle to adjust the flow of solution as needed.\n\n\n\nPrepared petri dish\n\n\nPipette 4 ml of 1 mM 3-AT sea water (prepared in the first step of “Collecting eggs and sperm”) into the PS-coated dish using a transfer pipette.\nPlace petri dish under microscope, such that the scratch mark is on the left.\nSwitch on the microscope and the FemtoJet 4i.

If you see the error message below, make sure that the injection tube is correctly attached to the FemtoJet, and that the needle in the needle holder is all the way in and the tube is screwed on right.\n\n\n\nMicroinjector error\n\n\nDefault microinjector settings: Manual, 120, 40.\nLower needle into the sea water using the macromanipulator. Once the needle touches the water, find the needle through the microscope and lower/adjust focus until the needle touches the bottom of the petri dish. Navigate to the scratch mark. Gently touch the scratch with the end of the needle to break it very slightly. Check with the fluorescent light that there is a good flow of solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Broken needle with scratch mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n(b) High speed of injection solution flow, this will be hard to work with\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n(c) Ideal speed of injection solution flow\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Setting up needle in the sea water\n\n\n\n\nRowing the eggs and fertilization\nLift the needle out of the liquid using the macromanipulator to avoid breaking the needle during rowing of the eggs.\nRow 10ul of dejellied eggs in a straight line using a 10 ul pipette tip. If the eggs have been sitting in the glass beaker for a while, they tend to stick to the bottom and pipetting up with the 10ul pipette tip might become difficult. Use a 3ml transfer pipette to pipette up and down near the eggs to stir them up.\n\n\n\nStir eggs with transfer pipette\n\n\nRow the eggs on the petri dish parallel and in-between the two lines mentioned above (marker and scratch mark lines) using a pipette. Row the eggs right before the injections, because fertilization problems may occur due to prolonged exposure to 3-AT sea water. Gently press the tip of the pipette to the bottom of the petri dish on the top, and move down in a line while continuously pushing out the eggs from the pipette tip.\n\n\n\nRow eggs in the petri dish\n\n\nFind the eggs with the microscope. Lower the needle back into the sea water and gently poke an egg to make sure they are stuck to the bottom.\nDilute and activate the sperm by adding 1ul of sperm into 100ul of sea water and mixing the water with the pipette tip for a few minutes until there are no chunks left and the solution is opaque and homogeneous. Add 10ul of diluted sperm directly on top of the top eggs. Submerge the tip and expel the sperm directly above, but be careful not to touch the eggs. Only fertilize a portion of the eggs at a time since the fertilized eggs become hardened and impossible to inject 10-15 minutes after fertilization. Once the fertilized eggs are injected and you move down to unfertilized eggs, repeat this step including the dilution of the sperm as after 10-15 minutes the activated sperm become less fertile.\n\n\n\nFertilized eggs with fertilization envelop\n\n\n\n\nMicroinjection of fertilized eggs\nOnce the eggs are fertilized (the fertilization envelop appears), push the needle against a fertilized egg such that it makes a dent in the middle of the cell.\nHit the side of the microscope with your hand to make the needle enter the cell. You might need to hit it repeatedly.\nYou can tell that the needle has entered the cell if:\n\nyou see the tension of the cell wall is released and the dent created by the needle disappears\nyou see some movement inside the cell as the flow of the injection solution from the needle in disturbing the cellular content\n\nAfter pressing the pedal, you should see a light area appear around the needle - this is called the injection bolus. Once the size for the injection bolus reaches 1/4 of the volume of the cell, pull out the needle. The cell should remain intact without anything flowing out of it. The injection bolus should disappear after 30 sec - 1 min.\nMove to the next cell using the micromanipulator and the stage controller. Repeat.\n\n\nVideo\nMicroinjection of fertilized eggs. Note: in this video the injection bolus didn’t reach the appropiate 1/4 size.\n\n\nWhen done (fertilized eggs hardened or injected enough eggs), remove the dish from the stage and carefully aspirate out water using a transfer pipette.\nDo not let the zygotes dry. Quickly add fresh prechilled sea water (from the 15°C fridge) to cover the dish. Label the petri dish (your name, date, time in hours and minutes, number of eggs injected, type of injection solution used). Incubate the embryos at 15°C.\n\n\nVisualising embryos\nWIP"

    "text": "Preparation of larvae\n\n24 hours post fertilisation\nDeveloping purple sea urchin larvae don’t detach from the bottom of the petri dish in the first 24 hours post fertilisation, therefore it is possible to look at them as they are under the microscope. Take out the perti dish from the incubator, take off the lid and put it under the microscope. You can check to see if you have a good number of injected individuals by setting the microscope filter to TRITC and switching on the fluorescent light. Make sure to switch off the light in the room. Injected larvae will glow red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed fluorescence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen fluorescence\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Signal detection without the computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf your gene of interest is expressed highly before 24 hpf and you want to check for green fluorescence, you can set the filter to FITC and repeat above step. However, the signal could be too weak for you to detect with your naked eyes and you might need to use the computer with a higher intensity fluorescent light and more sensitive camera. You will also need to use the computer to quantifying the GFP signal. Additionally, because the plastic of the petri dish could mess with the fluorescence data, I recommend to follow the steps below for GFP detection even pre-24hpf.\n\n\n\n\n24+ hours post fertilisation\nAfter 24 hours the larvae detach from the bottom and can move around in the water column - first due to microcurrents, later due to the ability to actively swim around - which makes looking at them in the petri dish extremely frustrating. For any kind of signal detection (either control red or GFP), larvae need to be fixed in place.\nStep 1: Pour sea water from the petri dish into a 10ml falcon tube. Spin the tube in a centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 minute. The larvae should spin down to the bottom.\nStep 2: Place two pieces of double-sided tape (3M Scotch 1/2 IN x 1296 IN) on a microscope slide. Pour off some of the sea water in the falcon tube to avoid submerging the pipette. Pipette ~30 ul from the bottom of the tube onto a microscope slide. Place a coverslip on the droplet of sea water. Press gently to make sure the coverslip sticks to the tape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPouring sea water into tube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverslip placement\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Preparing microscope slide\n\n\nSince the sea water will dry up, you usually will have around 30-45 minutes to image the larvae, but that should be enough."

Then, push up the bottom part with the weight and screw in the bottom screw. For a two-stage pull (used in this protocol), the bottom part of the needle puller with the weight should not be touching the stopper.

Wait a few minutes for the solution to reach the bottom of the needle.\n\n\n\nFilling needles\n\n\nMount needle onto the macromanipulator:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Insert needle into needle holder, end first, make sure needle end is visible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Needle in needle holder\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Using the needle holder (aka grip head)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Take off capillary holder (metal rod) and screw in needle holder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Make sure that the capillary holder is at 30°\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Setting up macromanipulator\n\n\n\n\nThe microinjection setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Confocal microscope set up\n\n\n\n\nPreparing sea water\nFor embryonic development:\nPrepare a beaker (1000 ml) with sea water (12°C, RO + instant ocean salt). Check for correct salinity (~33%)! Adjust salinity if needed. Place in 15°C fridge.\nFor during the microinjection:\nPour 25 ml of the filtered sea water into a 50 ml centrifuge tube and add 25ul of 1M 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) stock solution1 to it. “Label as 3AT filtered sea water”. Place the 3AT sea water on ice.\n\n\nPreparing the petri dish\nTake a PS-coated petri dish2, mark middle with a straight black line with marker on the outer side of the dish. Take a razor blade and make a cut parallel to the black line halfway between the black line and the edge of the dish on the inner side of the dish. This scratch will be important to break the injection needle to adjust the flow of solution as needed.\n\n\n\nPrepared petri dish\n\n\nPipette 4 ml of 1 mM 3-AT sea water (prepared in the first step of “Collecting eggs and sperm”) into the PS-coated dish using a transfer pipette.\nPlace petri dish under microscope, such that the scratch mark is on the left.\nSwitch on the microscope and the FemtoJet 4i. Make sure to detach the injection tube first!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Switch on power strip to switch on microscope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Switch on FemtoJet with the button on the back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) FemtoJet starts to build up pressure automatically, make sure tube is disconnected\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Turning on equipment\n\n\nOnce the pressure has built up, attach the injection tube to the FemtoJet (TODO note about the ring size). If you see the error message below, make sure that the injection tube is correctly attached to the FemtoJet, and that the needle in the needle holder is all the way in and the tube is screwed on right.\n\n\n\nMicroinjector error\n\n\nDefault microinjector settings: Manual, 120, 40.\nLower needle into the sea water using the macromanipulator. Once the needle touches the water, find the needle through the microscope and lower/adjust focus until the needle touches the bottom of the petri dish. Navigate to the scratch mark. Gently touch the scratch with the end of the needle to break it very slightly. Check with the fluorescent light that there is a good flow of solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Broken needle with scratch mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n(b) High speed of injection solution flow, this will be hard to work with\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n(c) Ideal speed of injection solution flow\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Setting up needle in the sea water\n\n\n\n\nRowing the eggs and fertilization\nLift the needle out of the liquid using the macromanipulator to avoid breaking the needle during rowing of the eggs.\nRow 10ul of dejellied eggs in a straight line using a 10 ul pipette tip. If the eggs have been sitting in the glass beaker for a while, they tend to stick to the bottom and pipetting up with the 10ul pipette tip might become difficult. Use a 3ml transfer pipette to pipette up and down near the eggs to stir them up.\n\n\n\nStir eggs with transfer pipette\n\n\nRow the eggs on the petri dish parallel and in-between the two lines mentioned above (marker and scratch mark lines) using a pipette. Row the eggs right before the injections, because fertilization problems may occur due to prolonged exposure to 3-AT sea water. Gently press the tip of the pipette to the bottom of the petri dish on the top, and move down in a line while continuously pushing out the eggs from the pipette tip.\n\n\n\nRow eggs in the petri dish\n\n\nFind the eggs with the microscope. Lower the needle back into the sea water and gently poke an egg to make sure they are stuck to the bottom.\nDilute and activate the sperm by adding 1ul of sperm into 100ul of sea water and mixing the water with the pipette tip for a few minutes until there are no chunks left and the solution is opaque and homogeneous. Add 10ul of diluted sperm directly on top of the top eggs. Submerge the tip and expel the sperm directly above, but be careful not to touch the eggs. Only fertilize a portion of the eggs at a time since the fertilized eggs become hardened and impossible to inject 10-15 minutes after fertilization. Once the fertilized eggs are injected and you move down to unfertilized eggs, repeat this step including the dilution of the sperm as after 10-15 minutes the activated sperm become less fertile.\n\n\n\nFertilized eggs with fertilization envelop\n\n\n\n\nMicroinjection of fertilized eggs\nOnce the eggs are fertilized (the fertilization envelop appears), push the needle against a fertilized egg such that it makes a dent in the middle of the cell.\nHit the side of the microscope with your hand to make the needle enter the cell. You might need to hit it repeatedly.\nYou can tell that the needle has entered the cell if:\n\nyou see the tension of the cell wall is released and the dent created by the needle disappears\nyou see some movement inside the cell as the flow of the injection solution from the needle in disturbing the cellular content\n\nAfter pressing the pedal, you should see a light area appear around the needle - this is called the injection bolus. Once the size for the injection bolus reaches 1/4 of the volume of the cell, pull out the needle. The cell should remain intact without anything flowing out of it. The injection bolus should disappear after 30 sec - 1 min.\nMove to the next cell using the micromanipulator and the stage controller. Repeat.\n\n\nVideo\nMicroinjection of fertilized eggs. Note: in this video the injection bolus didn’t reach the appropiate 1/4 size.\n\n\nWhen done (fertilized eggs hardened or injected enough eggs), remove the dish from the stage and carefully aspirate out water using a transfer pipette.\nDo not let the zygotes dry. Quickly add fresh prechilled sea water (from the 15°C fridge) to cover the dish. Label the petri dish (your name, date, time in hours and minutes, number of eggs injected, type of injection solution used). Incubate the embryos at 15°C. It is recommended to put the petri dishes with the embryos in sealed boxes with a wet paper towel to minimize evaporation of water from the sea water."

See image below. You will get an error message if you open the application first. (Once the application is open it might show a warning message about the OKO device, just hit cancel.)\nStep 2: Place the microscope slide under the microscope, coverslip facing the objective (coverslip side down when using an inverted microscope).\nNIS-elements application interface:\n\n\n\nSoftware interface\n\n\nStep 3: Click on the Eye Port button and use the microscope eye port to locate and focus the larvae. Then, click on the Scan button to switch to the camera view. If the Remove Interlock button is red, it means that while the laser is on, but the shutter is in place (as indicated by the lack of light under the “Shutter Open” on the laser box). Click Remove Interlock to remove the shutter. You should see the laser hitting your sample under the microscope (if any of the lasers are selected and switched on in the left menu on the screen).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitching on fluorescent light, shutter is closed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShutter is open\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Switchin on laser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on checking fluorescence with eyes:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can always check for fluorescent signal with your eyes using the method described in the 24 hpf visualization step above. Switch to the TRITC or FITC filters and switch on the laser with the black button. You’ll have to select the Eye Port view in the software first. IMPORTANT: Make sure to switch to an empty filter before switching back to the computer view, otherwise you’ll see nothing on the computer!\n\n\n\nStep 4: Adjust the sliders for the different fluorescent signals such that the gain is as high as possible without the background of the sample being too noisy, and such that the distribution of pixel signal intensities is as below. Set the laser intensity low to avoid damaging the sample, but high enough for appropriate levels of excitation. In my experience, the following values will achieve this:\neGFP gain 115, laser intensity 10. Texas Red gain 120, laser intensity 2.\nThis is what the various pixel distributions should look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo injection control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo contstruct control injection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGFP expression signal\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Figures in the software showing the distribution of pixel signal intensities. X-axis is intensity, y-axis is number of pixels with that value.\n\n\nStep 5: Once you find a larvae with GFP expression, save the image (File -&gt; Save). It will save the pixel values as well as the settings you used to take the image.\nExample image of GFP expression:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGFP only view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombined signals view\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PMC specific expression of GFP\n\n\nGood luck! :)"
