We would like to thank Jian Ming Khor and Gary Wessel for their useful tips and helpful correspondence.

## Goals {.unnumbered}

**Functional validation of candidate regulatory variation**

Sub aim: Developing a reliable and efficient method in the lab

Main idea: GFP reporter construct with modified regulatory region microinjected into fertilized sea urchin eggs -> output intensity of fluorescence, could be:

* Tissue specific
* Developmental time specific
* Genetic background specific
* Environment specific

### Primary gene of interest

**ECM3 - extracellular matrix protein 3**. LOC579397 / SPU_001796. 

* Outlier putatively adaptive cis-regulatory variant. 
* Down-regulated in populations most frequently exposed to ph <7.8 & up-regulated in populations less frequently exposed to ph <7.8.
* In a conserved promoter region with L. variegatus (50 Mya).
* High expression during early development
* Important biomineralisation gene.
