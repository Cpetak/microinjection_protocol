Prepare the following injection solution, preferably the same day it is going to be used.

| Ingradient     | Final Quantity in 20 ul | Volume to be added |
| :--- | :---: | ------: |
| Linearised construct        |   100ng   | Depends on construct concentration |
| gDNA           |   500ng   | Depends on construct concentration |
| KCl (1M)    |  0.12M   | 2.4 ul |
| Glycerol (50%) |  20%   | 8 ul |
| Control dye (10%) |  0.25%   | 0.5 ul |
| ddH2O |  -   | To add up to 20 ul |
